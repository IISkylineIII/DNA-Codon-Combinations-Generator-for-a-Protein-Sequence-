# DNA-Codon-Combinations-Generator-for-a-Protein-Sequence-

# Description

This script computes the total number of possible DNA sequences that can encode a given protein sequence, considering all possible synonymous codons for each amino acid.


# The program:

* Takes an input amino acid sequence (in this case: CYCLIC)
* Maps each amino acid to its possible codons based on the standard genetic code
* Uses Cartesian product to generate all possible combinations of DNA sequences
* Outputs the total number of valid DNA sequences

# Example Output

Total number of DNA sequences: 2304

# Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required (uses itertools from the Python standard library)

# Applications

* Useful in synthetic biology and genetic engineering
* Codon optimization for gene synthesis
* Studying redundancy in the genetic code
